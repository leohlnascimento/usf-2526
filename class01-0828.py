    01. Interpreter vs Compiler
        - python uses an Interpreter, which reads the program line by line;
        - single quotes will make the Interpreter expect a string;
        - a Compiler reads the entire content before it executes any code
          (that's why it's usually faster), while an Interpreter executes throughout
          the reading of the code
    
    02. General Notes
        - the backslash(\) is an escape character; it can be used, for example,
          to print specific things that the Interpreter would maybe not understand
          without the backslash
